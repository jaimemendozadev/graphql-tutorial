## Initial Setup

Open up your terminal and clone the repo locally to your computer by running the following command at the target destination: `$ git clone https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/graphql-tutorial.git`



## Starting the App

In the root of the app, use your terminal to run `$ yarn install` to install all the app dependencies. Wait until everything finishes loading.

Open a second tab in your terminal and run the command `$ yarn run server:build` to have babel build the server. Manually run `$ yarn run server:build` every time you make a change to the files in the `server` folder.

Finally in the first terminal tab, or in another opened terminal tab, run the command `$ yarn run dev:start` to start the GraphQL server.

Go to `http://localhost:3000/graphiql` to run queries!
